# Examples

This directory contains examples that should help get you started with Flux.

## [./flux-todomvc](./flux-todomvc)

This is the simplest example. It walks you through creating the classic [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application using a reference Flux implementation. It does not describe how to create the reference Flux implementation, that will be saved for a later example.

## [./flux-flow](./flux-flow)

This is a very simple example that highlights how to set up Flux and
[Flow](https://flowtype.org/) in the same project. Flow is a static-type
checking tool that will help catch errors in your code statically. It
complements Flux well since it supports refining the action based on a
type string.
