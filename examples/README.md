# Examples

This directory contains examples that should help get you started with Flux.

## [./flux-todomvc](./flux-todomvc) - Start here

This example is where you should start. It walks you through creating the
classic [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application using a simple Flux
implementation.

## [./flux-jest](./flux-jest) - Unit Testing

**TODO: Write this.**

## [./flux-flow](./flux-flow) - Static typing

This is a very simple example that highlights how to set up Flux and
[Flow](https://flowtype.org/) in the same project. Flow is a static-type
checking tool that will help catch errors in your code statically. It
complements Flux well since it supports refining the action based on a
type string.

## [./flux-async](./flux-async) - Flux with async requests

**TODO: Write this.**

## [./flux-logging](./flux-logging) - Add logging to Flux apps

Taking advantage of the fact that a store gets every action makes it easy to
add logging to a Flux application. Check out this quick example where we add
a logger store to the TodoMVC app we created in an earlier example.
