# flux-shell

This is a very simple hello world app that you can use as a starting point for your application.

# usage

```bash
cd path/to/flux-shell
npm install
npm run build
# open path/to/flux-shell/index.html in your browser
```

# watch

Instead of manually building after each change it's possible to automatically recompile the javascript bundle when files change:

```bash
npm run watch
# make javascript changes, then refresh path/to/flux-shell/index.html
```
